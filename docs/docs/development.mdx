# Development

During development, you can use Quirrel's lightweight local server.
This runs entirely on your machine, without needing any database or other external services.

After installing Quirrel via `npm install quirrel`, the local server is started by running `quirrel` in your terminal.
This will start a server and automatically start scanning for CronJobs in your project.
If you're using the default development port of your framework (like `:3000` for Next.js), then Quirrel will automatically detect and use the local server.

You can run `quirrel ui` to open up an admin interface that could be useful in local development.

To always run Quirrel as part of your local development environment, you can add it to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently 'next dev' 'quirrel'"
}
```
